# AVR Exploration

This is a project that is inteded to explore some of the more advanced features that the Atmega328p offeres by programming this in Embedded C. I am using the Arduino Uno Rev3 as a development board because of how easily accessible it is. I have also purchased an Atmel ICE to program the chip through its ICSP header using SPI. I am using Atmel Studio 7 as the development enviroment and the following datasheets for reference material.
